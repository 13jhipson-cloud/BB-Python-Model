# Iteration 0: No Adjustments

This is the baseline iteration. No adjustments have been made.

The original methodology is based on pure modeling logic:
- Historical rate averages for stable metrics
- Trend extrapolation for seasoning metrics
- Donor cohort approaches for young cohorts

The variances from this baseline will inform what adjustments (if any) are needed,
and importantly, what the **modeling rationale** for those adjustments should be.
